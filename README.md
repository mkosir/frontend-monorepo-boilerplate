Frontend monorepo with focus on best practices and painless developer experience:

- Monorepo setup that can be easily extended ðŸ”§
- Spin it up with single command ðŸŒ€
- TypeScript 100% codebase
- Blazing fast builds, lints, tests with Turborepo [remote caching](https://turborepo.org/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) âš¡

## Requirements

- [Node v20+](https://nodejs.org/)

## Running

_Easily set up a local development environment_

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run dev` - Start all apps ðŸš€

Visit one of the monorepo apps [localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100/)

## Features:

- [Turborepo v1](https://turborepo.org/) remote cache build system, with fast execution of commands (build, lint, test etc.) on your local machine and CI
- [TypeScript v5](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) codebase with [typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) [`strict-type-checked`](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs/#strict-type-checked) and
  [`stylistic-type-checked`](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs/#stylistic-type-checked) configurations enabled.
- [Next.js v14](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) apps
- Monorepo implements 3 styling solutions with shared theme across all apps (pick your use case and remove others).  
  Easily import UI components package into apps:
  - [Vanilla CSS package](https://github.com/mkosir/frontend-monorepo-boilerplate/tree/main/packages/ui)
  - [Tailwind](https://github.com/mkosir/frontend-monorepo-boilerplate/tree/main/packages/ui-tailwind) components library built with [Tailwind v3](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [Material UI](https://github.com/mkosir/frontend-monorepo-boilerplate/tree/main/packages/ui-mui) components library built with [MUI v5](https://mui.com/)
- Unit and integration tests with [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library). Run a single test in any monorepo app/package [instantly](https://github.com/mkosir/typescript-style-guide/raw/main/misc/vscode-jest-runner.gif).
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter
- Git hooks with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
- Commit messages must meet [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.  
  After staging changes just run `npm run commit` and get instant feedback on your commit message formatting and be prompted for required fields by [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

## Coding Guidelines

Convention over configuration should be followed as much as possible as described in [TypeScript Style Guide](https://github.com/mkosir/typescript-style-guide).

TLDR:

- **Code is organized and grouped by feature.** Collocate code as close as possible to where it's relevant. [&#11107;](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#code-collocation)
- Strive for data immutability. [&#11107;](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#data-immutability)
- Strive for functions to be pure, stateless and have single responsibility. [&#11107;](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#functions)
- Majority of function arguments should be required (use optional sparingly). [&#11107;](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#required--optional-args)
- Embrace const assertions. [&#11107;](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#const-assertion)
- Strong emphasis to keep naming conventions consistent and readable. [&#11107;](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#naming-conventions)
- Use named exports. [&#11107;](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#named-export)
- Use of server-state library is encouraged ([react-query](https://github.com/tanstack/query), [apollo client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client)...). [&#11107;](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#store--pass-data)
- Use of client-state library for global state is discouraged. [&#11107;](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#store--pass-data)
- UI components must only show derived state and send events, nothing more (no business logic). [&#11107;](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#component-types)
- Test business logic, not implementation details. [&#11107;](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#what--how-to-test)

## Monorepo

Monorepo features and conventions:

- Monorepo is opinionated in order to achieve best developer experience. It's meant to be used as frontend only monorepo, 100% TypeScript, consistent codebase across whole monorepo with automated tooling in place as ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, conventional commits etc.
- Workspaces:
  - It comes with two workspaces `apps` and `packages`.
  - All configurations (eslint, jest, tailwind etc.) in `packages` are always prefixed with "config-" and imported into other workspaces directly from source without building (never transpiled).
  - All other `packages` beside configurations are always being built/transpiled to `dist/` folder.
- Merging to `main` branch deploys to `stage` environment, creating new GitHub release deploys to `production`.
- For consistency all applications in monorepo are built with Next.js, but can be easily replaced with any other React framework/tooling (Vite, Remix etc.)
- Monorepo doesn't implement any high-level architectures (islands, micro-frontends), but is prepared with that in mind, so it can be easily extended (page composition, adding shared state etc.)
